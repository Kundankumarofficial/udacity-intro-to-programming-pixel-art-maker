Udacity description of the project:

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build
the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user
create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply
colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1.	Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2.	Choose a color.
3.	Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that
dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

design.js was based in the code presented at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtSiwcq67j4. Code was then
reworked to replace jquery with JavaScript code.
